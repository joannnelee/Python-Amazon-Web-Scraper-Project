# Python Amazon Web Scraper Project

### Project Overview

In this project, data will be scraped from Amazon and put into a pandas data frame. The data will be collected on the price of a product sold on Amazon over various timestamps to track any price changes. 

### Tools

- Jupyter Notebooks: python

### Steps
1. Import libraries.
2. Connect to the website and pull in data.
3. Clean up data.
4. Create a timestamp for the output to track when data was collected.
5. Create CSV and write headers and data into the file.
6. Append data to the CSV.
7. Creating function 'check_price' so the process can be automated.
8. Set a timer for 'check_price' to be run after a set amount of time and input data into CSV.
